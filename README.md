# Eaglercraft 26.2 Workspace

**Please note** that this project is still in the working. This template has no
source code whatsoever in it and is just a AI made teavm template until I finish
the actual port and upload it onto here. For now, u can try port with this ig

Minecraft **Java Edition 26.2** → Eagler runtime → **TeaVM** → browser.

A serious source-porting workspace that consumes a legitimate local decompile of
Minecraft Java Edition 26.2, patches out desktop/LWJGL-only APIs, and compiles
the result through the real Eagler-fork TeaVM toolchain into a browser client
(JavaScript today; WASM-GC documented as experimental).

> **Version integrity.** This workspace is built around 26.2. It does not rename
> a 1.8/1.14/26.1 client and label it 26.2. Until a legitimate 26.2 decompiled
> source is provided, the browser targets compile the **Eagler runtime + a
> labelled pipeline demo** (not a fake full client). Every claimed feature is
> gated on a passing real-browser test — see `docs/FEATURE_PARITY.md`.

- **Repository:** https://github.com/NT9712/eaglercraft-262-workspace
- **Docs & live client:** https://deploy-docs-psi.vercel.app/
  (open in a browser; the live client demo is under `/client/` — Note: Vercel
   free-tier Deployment Protection may prompt for login on first visit.)

## Status (verified in real headless Chromium)
- ✅ TeaVM JS client **boots** — zero console errors, canvas renders.
- ✅ Migration matrix + TeaVM pipeline + Eagler runtime seam.
- 🟡 WASM-GC / desktop debug scaffolded (see docs).
- ➖ Full 26.2 gameplay requires the legitimate decompiled source (see
  `docs/source-input.md`).

## Requirements
- Java 17 (toolchain enforced by Gradle)
- Gradle 8.14 (wrapper included, auto-downloads)
- Node 20+ (only for the optional browser smoke test)
- A legitimate local copy of the Minecraft 26.2 client JAR (to port the real game)

## Build the browser (JavaScript) client
```bash
./gradlew :target_teavm_javascript:buildEaglerJS
./gradlew :target_teavm_javascript:stageClient
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory dist/client
# open http://localhost:8080
```

## Browser smoke test
```bash
node tests/browser_smoke.js /path/to/chrome
```
